## Spot On: Software Edition

Spot On was a CIID IDP 2015 Enchanted Objects project, which explored a tangible, “socialized” interface for streaming radio services such as Spotify.

By tangible we mean that the hardware prototype took the form of a felt-covered disc, about 60cm in diameter, which concealed a speaker as well as magnets and Hall Effect sesors. Felt ball “tokens” with magnets are used to trigger song playback.

By socialized we mean that the mode of interacting with the device — placing tokens at various positions on its surface — is intended to be social in nature. When tokens are moved, the device calculates the distribution of tokens within each of its rings, in order to build a profile of the energy level of music desired. More tokens closer to the center will result in higher-energy music, while more tokens towards the disc‘s outer edges will produce calmer music. Spot On uses this mood variable to parse whatever playlists have been supplied to it by the people that use it.
